                HIGHLIGHTS OF PM SPEECH ON INDEPENDENCE DAY IN RED FORT<br>
                It is true that India faces a lot of problems, but we have the capacity to find solutions.<br>
                It is our responsibility to convert our Swaraj into Suraaj, which can not be done without sacrifice, discipline and staunch resolution.<br>
                Suraaj means the progress of the common man, a govt that is sensitive to the requirements and aspirations of the common man. Responsibility and accountability are to be the roots of such a Suraaj.<br>
 In the past any businessman who wanted to invest in this country had to spend more than six months just registering his business. However, we have simplified the procedure to an extent that in last July itself, 900 such registrations have taken place.
 Out of 18,000 villages, more than 10,000 villages have been electrified and I have been told they are with us, watching this celebration of Independence Day.<br>
 When things like the coming together of Iran, Afghanistan and India come together for Chabahar port, then one can see the impossible becoming possible.<br>
 We haven't allowed inflation to go beyond 6 per cent. There were two years of successive drought in the country. Production of pulses became a concerns, but despite all that we tried our best to control the situation and compared to previous governments, I and my government did not allow the cost of a poor man's thaali [plate] to be unaffordable.<br>
 As we celebrate the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji I remember what he said: "He who hasn't served others, how can his hands be considered holy?" I say our farmers do such work and have sown 1.5 times the pulses that were sown earlier, despite the discouragement of successive droughts.<br>
 Our scientists have created 131 types of high yielding variety seeds, so that we maximise output. I congratulate them. The shortage of fertilizer is like something out of a bad dream of the past. That shortage is history.<br>
 Ramanujacharya used to say that we must look at everyone with the same gaze, never humiliate anyone. This was said by Ambedkar, Gandhi too. If society practices this discrimination it will break society. If discrimination is entrenched, our determination to fight it and our sensitivity to fighting it should be that much higher. Just economic progress is not enough, social equity is more important. We have to fight social evils together.<br>
This govt does not believe in postponing things. We have fulfilled our promise of one rank one pension. We have released all files relating to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. That was another promise we had made.<br>
   Violence has no place in our country. This country will not tolerate terrorism and Maoism.<br>
   I tell those who believe in human values, to "weigh in the scale of humanity, when innocent children were massacred in a school in Peshawar. In India, every school was weeping, there were tears in the eyes of every parliamentarian. That was a reflection of our human value, but look at the other side which glorifies terrorists."<br>
   I say to our neighbours, "Let's fight poverty, by fighting our own people we will destroy ourselves, only by fighting poverty together will we prosper."<br>
