                Introduction:<br>

E-Governance can be defined as the use of information and communication technologies by

government to enhance the range and quality of information and services provided to citizens,

business, civil society organizations and other government agencies in an efficient cost

effective way and convenient manner, making government process more transparent and

accountable and strengthening democracy.<br>

E-governance play an crucial role in providing better government services to citizens,

improved interactions with business and industry, citizen empowerment through access to

information e.t.c.<br>

As former president Late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam sir once uttered that “ A transparent smart e-

Governance with seamless access, secure and authentic flow of information crossing the in

departmental barrier and providing a fair and unbiased services to the citizen. ‘’

The goal of e-Governance is not merely to computerise governmental records; to the contrary

the ultimate goal of e-Governance to transform the governance. Indeed, successful e-

Governance is about 20% technology and at least 80% people , processes, and organisations.

e-governance is not an end rather it is the start to pervade all government operations.

E-Governance can transfer citizen services, provide access to information to empower

citizens, enable their participation in government and enhance citizen economic and social

opportunities, so that they can make better lives, for themselves and for the next generation.
